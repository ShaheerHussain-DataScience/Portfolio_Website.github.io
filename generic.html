									<h3 class="major">Personal Profile</h3>
									<p>Hi! I’m Shaheer Hussain, a Data Analyst Apprentice at the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and a Digital and Technology Solutions student at ADA, the National College for Digital Skills. I’ve always been curious about how data can tell stories and help people make smarter decisions, which is what drew me into analytics. I love exploring data with tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Python, and finding new ways to turn numbers into clear insights. Whether it’s building dashboards, automating reports, or diving into a tricky dataset, I enjoy solving problems that make an impact.</p>

									<p>During my time at ADA, the National College for Digital Skills, I’ve had the opportunity to study a wide range of modules that have built a strong foundation in both technical and analytical thinking. My learning journey has covered everything from the System Development Lifecycle and User Interface Design, to more data-focused modules such as Statistics for Data Analysis, Database Systems, and Data Analysis Concepts. I’ve developed programming skills through Computer Programming (Python) and Data Analysis in Python, progressing into advanced topics like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Big Data Analysis. Alongside these technical areas, modules like Ethics and Commercial Reasoning, Digital Leadership, and Data and Business Insights have helped me understand the broader impact of data in business and society, preparing me to deliver analytical work that’s not only accurate, but also responsible and impactful.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Future Goals</h3>
									<p>My biggest goal right now is to pursue a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science to deepen my understanding of advanced analytical concepts and emerging technologies. I’m particularly interested in exploring how AI and machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems and drive innovation across industries. By continuing my academic journey, I aim to strengthen both my technical expertise and my ability to translate complex data into meaningful insights that create value and support ethical, data-driven decisions. Ultimately, I want to contribute to projects that make a tangible impact whether that’s improving public services, enhancing business intelligence, or driving forward innovation in data science.</p>
